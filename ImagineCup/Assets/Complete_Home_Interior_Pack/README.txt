Complete Home Interior Pack 2.0

An extremely versatile and affordable set of interior items and building pieces: walls, floor & ceiling, windows & doors, furniture, decor and even food and toiletries. Pack includes both Unity 4 and Unity 5 versions.

All assets come with prefabs varying in style and are ready to use, but if you can't find what you like - it's easy to customise. From cute to modern, you have plenty of colours and materials to choose from.

Building your home is easy, quick and fun! Just drag and drop an asset into your scene. For even faster building there are 20 prefab rooms and 3 complete homes. All in all the pack comes with 141 models and 1474 prefabs.

All furniture and appliances can be opened and closed!

As an added bonus you get 50 Nekobolt demo items from 4 of our asset packs - ranging from toothpaste to breakfast cereal!

We will be adding more content to this pack and the price will go up, but everyone who already owns the package will of course get all updates for free.
